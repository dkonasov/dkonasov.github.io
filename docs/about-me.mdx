# About me

<img src="/me.png" alt="Me" className={styles.avatar} />
My name is Dmitrii Konasov, I am a software developer. Since 2014 I create web sites, apps and services.

Despite most of my commercial experience is connected with web, I am keen on IT and computer science in general. I have at least basic knowledge almost in all modern and popular programming languages. My main hobby is to learn something new, which leads me to endless journey in the quest for knowledge.
